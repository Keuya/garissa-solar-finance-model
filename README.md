# Garissa Solar Finance Model 🌞

This repository contains a **financial + engineering model** for the Garissa Solar Project in Kenya.  
It explores how project design choices (capacity, efficiency, degradation, tariffs) influence **IRR, NPV, and bankability** in emerging market contexts.

## 🔧 Key Features
- PV generation and capacity factor analysis
- Cashflow modeling (NPV, IRR, DSCR)
- Sensitivity to efficiency losses, tariff shifts, and financing terms
- Focused on **electricity markets in emerging economies**

## 📊 Why This Matters
Small engineering assumptions ripple into big financial outcomes.  
This model demonstrates:
- How efficiency links to project bankability  
- How PV can support cooling demand and peak load relief  
- Why integrating finance + engineering is critical for Africa’s energy transition  

## 🤝 Collaboration
I’m open to collaborating on:
- Improving modeling methods (Python/R integration, automation)
- Benchmarking PV projects across African and global markets
- Exploring use cases with **DFIs, investors, and developers**
